# Welcome to Group2's Robotic Project!

## Hardware Requirements
1. Hiwonder Armpi Pro with Raspberry Pi
2. Yahboom Autopilot Track Map UV printing canvas (2.8m * 3.2m)
   
   *Note: You'll most likely need a screwdriver.*

## Environment Requirements
1. Python==3.8
2. ROS system

## Instruction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `main.py` using the command: `python3 main.py`
3. In default mode, the task will be randomly generated by navigation.
   - You may customize your task by setting the destination and pick-up place manually in `navigation.py`.
4. Any modification for the map can be done in `config.py`.
   - You may use `mapping.py` to extract your map info.
5. Traffic signal detection can be customized in `hardware_control.py`.
6. The face detection module is currently only used at the destination place due to performance restrictions.

## To-Do

In future versions, we'll focus on the improvement of the detection model and logic with higher accuracy and wider applicability.
